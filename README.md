# CivSim2
My first big project in Python, an AI-only game made in Python 3.9.1 and Pygame 2.0.1

## How does it work
I used Pygame to create and render the map in *Engine.py*, to create the former I used a perlin noise library, found in *requirements.txt*

## How to run
After installing the libraries in *requirements.txt*:
Linux:
```
python3 Main.py
```
Windows:
```
python Main.py
```
