This is where I try to implement and discuss ideas on how to make a nation expand/develop.

Each turn, each nation will get some influence points according to:
-Each tile's influence bonus, based on available resources
-The leader prosperity
-Current wars with other nations

The total population of each nation also pays taxes in the form of money, that will give bonuses to this nation.

The main uses of Influnce are:
-To "maintain" tiles, each tile has a certain maintenance per turn, based on its value
-To take tiles away from other nations
-To develop the nation's tiles and keep them from revolting.

After calculating the new influence value there are 3 possible outcomes:
-The nation will have an increasing amount of influence
-The nation won't have either a increasing or decreasing amount of influence, so it stays the same
-The nation will have a decreasing amount of influence

With an increasing amount of influence, the nation will try to conquer more land.
With a neutral amount of influence, it will try to develop it's tiles.
With a decreasing/negative (both) amount of influence, the nation will probably lose territory to revolts/other nations.
